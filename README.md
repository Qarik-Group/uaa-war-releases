# UAA WAR files

The [UAA releases](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/releases) are regularly published but do not include pre-built `.war` files. This project describes a CI pipeline that detects all UAA releases, compiles them into versioned `.war` files which are stored as versioned GitHub releases.

You can also find UAA artifacts on Maven at https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.cloudfoundry.identity
